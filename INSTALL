Running Siren from the source directory
---------------------------------------

To run Siren from the source directory (i.e. without installing it first), run
the following commands.

	./configure plugindir="$PWD"
	make
	./siren

Should you later wish to install Siren after all, then ensure you reconfigure
and rebuild it first so that the plugindir variable is set to a proper value.
It is perhaps safest to start from a clean source directory. Therefore, run the
following command before reconfiguring.

	make cleandir

Uninstalling Siren
------------------

Siren can be uninstalled with the following command.

	make uninstall
